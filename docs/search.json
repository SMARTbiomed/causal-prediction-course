    "text": "Estimands for causal prediction\nPart 1: QRisk\nQRisk is a risk prediction model that provides estimates of the 10-year risk of having a heart attack or stroke. The QRisk tool is available online at https://www.qrisk.org/index.php\n\nUse the online calculator for a person A with the following characteristics (you can leave the other information blank):\n\nPerson A: 45 years old, male, Indian ethnicity, non-smoker, without diabetes. What is this person’s risk of developing a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years? Consider another individual, person B, who is similar to person A, except they are on blood pressure treatment.\nPerson B: 45 years old, male, Indian ethnicity, non-smoker, without diabetes, on blood pressure medication.\nWhat is this person’s predicted risk of developing a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years, and how does it differ from the risk for person A?\n\nDiscuss some possible reasons for the differences in the risks for person A and person B.\nBased on these findings, discuss whether you would suggest that person B should stop taking their blood pressure treatment.\nSuppose person A has a systolic blood pressure of 150, which is considered high. Would you advise against person A initiating blood pressure medication based on the predictions from this model?\nWhat do you conclude about using this model to inform whether a person should start or stop blood pressure lowering medication?\n\nPart 2: Developing an interventional risk prediction model for blood pressure treatment\nIn this part we will suppose that we would like to develop a model that could help individuals to decide about whether they should consider initiating blood pressure medication in order to lower their risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\n\nDiscuss what you might want such a risk prediction model to do in more detail by considering the elements in the table below. This table is taken from Luijken et al. 2024. https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.70011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimand element\nQuestions that help formulate the estimand element\n\n\n\n\nTarget population\n\nTo which individuals will the prediction model be applied?\nIn which health care setting will the prediction model be applied?\n\n\n\nMoment(s) of intended use\n\nAt which moment(s) is the prediction model (re)consulted to inform the intervention decision?\n\n\n\nIntervention options\n\nWhich intervention options are relevant at the moment(s) of making the intervention decision?\nFor how long should the intervention strategy be fixed?\nShould the duration to fix the intervention option be aligned with the time till next moment of prediction?\n\n\n\nOutcome and prediction horizon\n\nWhich outcome(s) are informative for the intervention decision?\nWhat prediction horizon provides important information for the intervention decision: a short-term or long-term horizon?\nShould the outcome be defined differently because of the specified intervention option(s)?\nShould the prediction horizon be aligned with the time till next moment of prediction?\n\n\n\nPredictor(s)\n\nWhich clinical and/or demographic patient factors are predictive of the outcome of interest?\nWhich measurements are available at the moment(s) of intended use?\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking about the causal effect of initiating blood pressure treatment on risk of heart attack or stroke, draw (by hand) a simple causal diagram (a directed acyclic graph – DAG) that might be expected to hold in observational data collected. Involve he following variables: sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood pressure medication use, and having a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIn the population to which the diagram refers, you can assume everyone is aged 45 and of the same ethnicity, to avoid needing to include these variables.\nAre there any other variables that you would add to the diagram?\n\nCan you indicate which variables would need to be adjusted for when targeting the estimand focused on informing initiation of blood pressure medication?\n\nPart 3. Prediction model for successful vaginal delivery\nSeveral models exist that predict a pregnant woman’s risk of a successful vaginal delivery (versus an emergency c-section), especially in woman who already had a c-section in a previous pregnancy. Here we will look at the MFMU prediction model: Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (MFMU)\nThe model development is described in the paper by Grobman et.al. An annotated version of this paper is available on the course’s github page.\n\nRead the relevant parts in the introduction and discussion of the paper (highlighted in yellow in the annotated paper) and determine the treatment decision the model is meant to inform. Which intervention options can patients choose between, and when?\nNow review the relevant parts in the methods section and write down the elements of the estimand targeted by the current model in the second column of the table below.\nAssess the relevance of the current estimand (question 2) to the treatment decision described in question 1.\nFormulate an alternative estimand that would be better aligned to the treatment decision the model aims to inform by writing down adjusted estimand elements in the third column of the table below.\nSuggest changes to the design of the study that would allow us to target the estimand chosen in question 4.\n\n\n\n\nEstimand element\nCurrent estimand targeted by Grobman et al.\nAlternative estimand better aligned to treatment decision\n\n\n\n\nTarget population\n\n\n\n\nMoment(s) of intended use\n\n\n\n\nOutcome and prediction horizon\n\n\n\n\nPredictor(s)\n\n\n\n\nIntervention options"

    "text": "The development of risk prediction algorithms has exploded in recent years in the medical research literature, yet few of these make their way into routine clinical practice. A primary purpose of prediction models is often stated as being to inform clinical decision making, such as whether to give a treatment to a particular patient. However, it has been shown that prediction models are typically not designed in a way that makes them a valid tool for informing such decisions, in particular because they do not appropriately accommodate the treatment decision at their design stage. Similarly, the evaluation of prediction models does not focus on how well the model would perform for the task of informing clinical decision making. A useful model should be evaluated from the perspective of its intended use and the intended users. Evaluation should consider not only predictive performance, but should also be based on costs and benefits which are defined by the clinical context and the available resources."
