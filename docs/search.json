    "text": "Exercises\n\nUsing the information provided in the table above write down the causal estimands of interest, following the notation used in the lecture slides.\n\nSolution: The estimands of interest are \\(\\Pr(Y^{1}=1| X^*)\\) and \\(\\Pr(Y^{0}=1|X^*)\\) where \\(Y^{1}\\) denotes the counterfactual outcome \\(Y\\) (CVD death within 5 years) under statin treatment, \\(Y^{0}\\) denotes the counterfactual outcome \\(Y\\) under no statin treatment. The predictors \\(X^*\\) are LDL, motion, polygenic risk score, sex, age, diabetes duration, smoking. The estimands could also be written in terms of expectations as \\(E(Y^{1}| X^*)\\) and \\(E(Y^{0}| X^*)\\).\n\nBased on the DAG you used in yesterday’s practical, we now consider which variables would need to to be included in an analysis in order to develop the causal prediction model, or in other words to enable estimation of \\(\\Pr(Y^{a}=1| X^*)\\) (\\(a=0,1\\)) from the data.\n\nWhat are the \\(L\\) variables and what are the \\(P\\) variables?\nWrite your causal estimand from question 1 in terms of the observed variables, and state your assumptions.\n\n\nSolution: The \\(L\\) variables (confounders of statin use and the outcome) are LDL_0, motion, steno_prs. The \\(P\\) variables (predictors of the outcome but not of statin use) are sex_male, age, diabetes_duration, smoking, SBP_0.\nThe causal estimands can be written as: \\(\\Pr(Y^{1}=1| X^*)=\\Pr(Y^{1}=1|L,P)=\\Pr(Y=1|A=1, L,P)\\) and \\(\\Pr(Y^{0}=1| X^*)=\\Pr(Y^{0}=1|L,P)=\\Pr(Y=1|A=0, L,P)\\). Writing the estimands in terms of the observed data relies on the assumption that \\(X^*=(L,P)\\) are sufficient to control for confounding of the association between statin use and the outcomes, and the consistency assumption.\n\nConsider the prediction model that you developed in the practical on Day 1 (afternoon). Is it suitable for making causal predictions, i.e. for estimating your estimand specified in question 1 above? Discuss why or why not.\n\nSolution: Points to consider are:\n\nWhat was the ‘time zero’ for your model, and does this align with the time at which you would wish to make the decision about statin use?\nDid your model include all the necessary \\(L\\) variables?\nDid your model include any variables on the causal pathway between statin use and the outcome?\n\n\nRead the training data and the test data into R.\n\nSolution:\n\ntrain &lt;- readRDS(url(\"https://smartbiomed.github.io/causal-prediction-course/data/exercises/data/type1-diabetes-train.rds\"))\n\ntest &lt;- readRDS(url(\"https://smartbiomed.github.io/causal-prediction-course/data/exercises/data/type1-diabetes-test.rds\"))\n\n\nCausal prediction modelling using the g-formula:\n\nUsing the g-formula approach develop a causal-prediction model using the training data that will enable you to estimate the estimand in 1.\nWhat assumptions are you making?\nBased on your model from (b), obtain an estimate of the 5-year risk of CVD death (i) under statin use and (ii) under non-statin use for each individual in the test data. Compare the estimates of risk under the two treatment options.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\nWe fit a logistic regression model including cvd_5year as the outcome \\(Y\\), separately for people with \\(A=1\\) (statin=1)and people with \\(A=0\\) (statin=0). The \\(L\\) variables and \\(P\\) variables (and hence \\(X^*=\\{L,P\\}\\) are as given in Question 2.

Adding a spline term could be a good idea, for example, though we do not use any splines for the continuous variables here due to the limited sample size.\nIt does not matter whether the \\(P\\) variables are entered in the correct form into the model - using an incorrect form will impact of predictive performance but will not invalidate the models as estimators for the estimand of interest.\nAn alternative would be to fit a combined model in the whole training data including \\(A\\) as a predictor, rather than fitting separate models for \\(A=0,1\\). The alternative model is fitted below. Compared with the separate models, this makes the additional assumption that there are no interactions between treatment use (statin) and any of the \\(X^*\\) variables included in the model.\n\n\nmod&lt;-glm(cvd_5year~statin+LDL_0+motion+steno_prs+sex_male+age+diabetes_duration+smoking+SBP_0,data=train,family=\"binomial\")\n\nsummary(mod)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = cvd_5year ~ statin + LDL_0 + motion + steno_prs + \n    sex_male + age + diabetes_duration + smoking + SBP_0, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = train)\n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

We are now in a situation where one of the \\(L\\) variables (steno_prs) is not in the set of predictors for the causal prediction model, \\(X^*\\). This means that, unlike in question 2, we cannot write \\(\\Pr(Y^{1}=1| X^*)=\\Pr(Y=1|A=1, X^*)\\).\nFirst note that the estimands can be written as \\(\\Pr(Y^{1}=1| X^*)=E\\left\\{\\frac{A}{\\Pr(A=1|L)}Y|X^*\\right\\}\\) and \\(\\Pr(Y^{0}=1| X^*)=E\\left\\{\\frac{(1-A)}{\\Pr(A=0|L)}Y|X^*\\right\\}\\), under assumptions that \\(L\\) is sufficient to control for confounding of the association between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\), and that we have positivity. The steps for estimating \\(\\Pr(Y^{1}=1| X^*)=E\\left\\{\\frac{A}{\\Pr(A=1|L)}Y|X^*\\right\\}\\) are: (i) Fit a model for \\(\\pi(L)=\\Pr(𝐴 = 1|𝐿)\\); (ii) Obtain the weights \\(1/\\pi(L)\\); (iii) Fit a weighted logistic regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(X^*\\) in people with \\(A=1\\), where the weights are \\(1/\\pi(L)\\).\n\nThe estimand \\(\\Pr(Y^{0}=1| X^*)=E\\left\\{\\frac{(1-A)}{\\Pr(A=0|L)}Y|X^*\\right\\}\\) can similarly be estimated by obtaining the weights \\(1/(1-\\pi(L))\\), and then fitting a weighted logistic regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(X^*\\) in people with \\(A=0\\), where the weights are \\(1/(1-\\pi(L))\\).\n\n\n\n\n#fit the propensity score model\nmod_ps&lt;-glm(statin~LDL_0+motion+steno_prs,data=train,family=\"binomial\")\n\n#obtain weights\npi_L&lt;-predict(mod_ps,newdata=train,type=\"response\")\ntrain$ipw&lt;-ifelse(train$statin==1,1/pi_L,1/(1-pi_L))\n\n#Fit weighted outcome model in those with A=1\nmod_ipw_A1&lt;-glm(cvd_5year~LDL_0+motion+sex_male+age+diabetes_duration+smoking+SBP_0,data=train[train$statin==1,],family=\"binomial\",weights=ipw)\n\nWarning in eval(family$initialize): non-integer #successes in a binomial glm!\n\n#Fit weighted outcome model in those with A=0\nmod_ipw_A0&lt;-glm(cvd_5year~LDL_0+motion+sex_male+age+diabetes_duration+smoking+SBP_0,data=train[train$statin==0,],family=\"binomial\",weights=ipw)\n\nWarning in eval(family$initialize): non-integer #successes in a binomial glm!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Obtain predictions\npred_A1_ipw&lt;-predict(mod_ipw_A1,newdata=test,type=\"response\")\n\npred_A0_ipw&lt;-predict(mod_ipw_A0,newdata=test,type=\"response\")\n\nThe plots below compare the predictions obtained using the IPW analysis, which excludes steno_prs from the set of predictors, and the g-formula analysis.

The QRisk tool is available online at https://www.qrisk.org/index.php\n\nUse the online calculator for a person A with the following characteristics (you can leave the other information blank):\n\nPerson A: 45 years old, male, Indian ethnicity, non-smoker, without diabetes. What is this person’s risk of developing a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years? Consider another individual, person B, who is similar to person A, except they are on blood pressure treatment.\nPerson B: 45 years old, male, Indian ethnicity, non-smoker, without diabetes, on blood pressure medication.\nWhat is this person’s predicted risk of developing a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years, and how does it differ from the risk for person A?\n\nDiscuss some possible reasons for the differences in the risks for person A and person B.\nBased on these findings, discuss whether you would suggest that person B should stop taking their blood pressure treatment.\nSuppose person A has a systolic blood pressure of 150, which is considered high. Would you advise against person A initiating blood pressure medication based on the predictions from this model?\nWhat do you conclude about using this model to inform whether a person should start or stop blood pressure lowering medication?\n\nPart 2: Developing an interventional risk prediction model for blood pressure treatment\nIn this part we will suppose that we would like to develop a model that could help individuals to decide about whether they should consider initiating blood pressure medication in order to lower their risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\n\nDiscuss what you might want such a risk prediction model to do in more detail by considering the elements in the table below. This table is taken from Luijken et al. 2024. https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.70011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimand element\nQuestions that help formulate the estimand element\n\n\n\n\nTarget population\n\nTo which individuals will the prediction model be applied?\nIn which health care setting will the prediction model be applied?\n\n\n\nMoment(s) of intended use\n\nAt which moment(s) is the prediction model (re)consulted to inform the intervention decision?\n\n\n\nIntervention options\n\nWhich intervention options are relevant at the moment(s) of making the intervention decision?\nFor how long should the intervention strategy be fixed?\nShould the duration to fix the intervention option be aligned with the time till next moment of prediction?\n\n\n\nOutcome and prediction horizon\n\nWhich outcome(s) are informative for the intervention decision?\nWhat prediction horizon provides important information for the intervention decision: a short-term or long-term horizon?\nShould the outcome be defined differently because of the specified intervention option(s)?\nShould the prediction horizon be aligned with the time till next moment of prediction?\n\n\n\nPredictor(s)\n\nWhich clinical and/or demographic patient factors are predictive of the outcome of interest?\nWhich measurements are available at the moment(s) of intended use?\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking about the causal effect of initiating blood pressure treatment on risk of heart attack or stroke, draw (by hand) a simple causal diagram (a directed acyclic graph – DAG) that might be expected to hold in observational data collected. Involve he following variables: sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood pressure medication use, and having a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIn the population to which the diagram refers, you can assume everyone is aged 45 and of the same ethnicity, to avoid needing to include these variables.\nAre there any other variables that you would add to the diagram?\n\nCan you indicate which variables would need to be adjusted for when targeting the estimand focused on informing initiation of blood pressure medication?\n\nPart 3. Prediction model for successful vaginal delivery\nSeveral models exist that predict a pregnant woman’s risk of a successful vaginal delivery (versus an emergency c-section), especially in woman who already had a c-section in a previous pregnancy. Here we will look at the MFMU prediction model: Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (MFMU)\nThe model development is described in the paper by Grobman et.al. An annotated version of this paper is available at this link.\n\nRead the relevant parts in the introduction and discussion of the paper (highlighted in yellow in the annotated paper) and determine the treatment decision the model is meant to inform. Which intervention options can patients choose between, and when?\nNow review the relevant parts in the methods section and write down the elements of the estimand targeted by the current model in the second column of the table below.\nAssess the relevance of the current estimand (question 2) to the treatment decision described in question 1.\nFormulate an alternative estimand that would be better aligned to the treatment decision the model aims to inform by writing down adjusted estimand elements in the third column of the table below.\nSuggest changes to the design of the study that would allow us to target the estimand chosen in question 4.\n\n\n\n\nEstimand element\nCurrent estimand targeted by Grobman et al.\nAlternative estimand better aligned to treatment decision\n\n\n\n\nTarget population\n\n\n\n\nMoment(s) of intended use\n\n\n\n\nOutcome and prediction horizon\n\n\n\n\nPredictor(s)\n\n\n\n\nIntervention options"

    "text": "The development of risk prediction algorithms has exploded in recent years in the medical research literature, yet few of these make their way into routine clinical practice. A primary purpose of prediction models is often stated as being to inform clinical decision making, such as whether to give a treatment to a particular patient. However, it has been shown that prediction models are typically not designed in a way that makes them a valid tool for informing such decisions, in particular because they do not appropriately accommodate the treatment decision at their design stage. Similarly, the evaluation of prediction models does not focus on how well the model would perform for the task of informing clinical decision making. A useful model should be evaluated from the perspective of its intended use and the intended users. Evaluation should consider not only predictive performance, but should also be based on costs and benefits which are defined by the clinical context and the available resources."
